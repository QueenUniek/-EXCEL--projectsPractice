BEFORE UPLOAD EXCEL INTO SQL:

0. Make a copy/Backup of datasets (in case)

1. remove duplicates 
> Select all > data > data tools(remove duplicates)

2.  change cases: =UPPER() = PROPER() =LOWER()

3. Select all > Filter 
(To look at attributes listed on our data column)
(To search any attributes that are different/distinct)
- filter/deselect certain attributes we can manually fix

4. Remove unnessary spacings
=TRIM()

5. Change currency symbol (usually dtype: test) into numbers
- to ensure sql proper filing
SELECT>HOME>NUMBER (change dtype)

6. Change date format
SELECT> HOME > NUMBER > DATE (SHORT DATE)

7. Copy our fixed column to existing column
SELECT> COPY> PASTE AS VALUES (Copied as String)
